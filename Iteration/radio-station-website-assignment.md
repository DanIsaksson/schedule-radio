ASSIGNMENT

# **Frontend app – public side**

## 1. Objective


You will further develop your frontend application in React for your radio

station client, focusing on the public, consumer, side of it.

## 2. Public frontend


Focus until now has been on the internal working of the radio station

business, especially on the scheduling. Now you will complement that part

with a public side. In terms of your frontend app, this public side will take

the center position. When you go to the homepage, it should be designed

for a consumer of the station. Arrange so that the scheduling part already

done can be accessed through the homepage, but that it has a less

prominent place.


You will have a lot of freedom to design the design the page. Set the level

of difficulty that suits your skills.


Check out these radio stations to get a sense of what they market to the

consumer and inform about:

## 3. Code Requirements


Benefit from the endpoints in the backend, but design from the frontend

side in an independent way, like if it was a separate project team.

## 4. Deadline


Work on this individual assignment until Friday November 21. Push your

code to your GitHub repository and share your repository URL with your

instructor before 15:00.
