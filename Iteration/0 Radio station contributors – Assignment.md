ASSIGNMENT

# **Contributor pages**

## 1. Objective

Your radio station client wants to add individual pages for their freelance contributors, accessible through the frontend app. The pages should allow contributors to register and check their personal data.

## 2. Contributors


- Contributors are considered available resources in the internal planning of the radio station. A contributor can be assigned to a scheduled event.

- A radio station admin creates new contributors. Contributors have an hourly cost and get paid each month based on the previous month’s contributions. Use a flat rate of 750 SEK/hour and an additional 300 SEK for any scheduled event. So an hour event would mean 1050 SEK and a two hour event 1800 SEK. Calculate a value added tax (VAT) of 25% on the total amount for the month. Contributors have personal data in the form of an address, phone, e
mail and their payment history. An optional data to add in the assignment is promotional material, like a photo and a short biographical summary.

## 3. Code Requirements


Create the necessary classes to cover the addition of the contributor. Each contributor should have an IdentityUser class attached, so that they need to authenticate themselves by login. The admin function of managing contributors needs to be protected endpoints that require login. Only authorized personel at the radio station should be able to access these endpoints. Develop the backend code to what you judge being a satisfying degree. The frontend code can be less developed, but should at least have a personal contributors page with the current data.

## 4. Deadline

Work on this individual assignment until Friday December 19. Push your code to your GitHub repository and share your repository URL with your instructor before 15:00.
