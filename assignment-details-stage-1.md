# 1. Radio station
Your client for this assignment is a radio station where your will set up a
system that schedules the station broadcast. The station has a 24/7 stream,
based on live sessions, prerecorded spoken material and music. You will
have to igure out how to help the station function well.  

# 2. Scheduling
• Content is scheduled seven days ahead.
• Days follow the calendar, so a new day at 24:00.
• The stream goes on each day for 24 hours.
• If no other content is scheduled, the station will play music.

## The station has two other content types:
- Pre-recorded reportage
- Live studio sessions. If the session is conducted by one host,
then it will be booked to Studio 1, which is a cheaper
alternative. Other sessions are booked to the Studio 2. If the
session has a guest, there is additional cost for guest transport.

3. Code Requirements
• The assignment will continue the coming week, when we begin with
web applications. Start the application as a console application, but be
aware of the coming change. Focus on the classes concerned with the
scheduling and avoid the Console in these classes.
• At this stage, tracking the economy is not an issue. But this might
change in the future.
• Consider creating strong typing (classes) for all the data scheduled,
also for the daily scheduling in itself.
• Consider that the schedule could be seen as a list of lists.  

# PERSONAL NOTES
I was sick when we got this first part of the assignment. I am struggling to comprehend a lot of the details and such. In order to progress I have to comprehend what is happening in my code and the core logic underpinning it, the ideas that flow through it (so to speak). I am building this as a web app already, so we can ignore the "start the application as a console applicaiton" from last week.
