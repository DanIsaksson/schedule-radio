# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Coding Exercises

## What You Have Now

✅ **Two Complete Coding Exercises** ready to use
✅ **Simple Test Endpoints** to practice with  
✅ **Visual Testing Interface** for easy experimentation
✅ **Working API** running on your local machine

## 🎯 Your Learning Path

### Step 1: Start Simple (5 minutes)
1. Open `http://localhost:5219/test-endpoints.html` in your browser
2. Click the blue buttons to test simple endpoints
3. See immediate results and understand how endpoints work

### Step 2: Try the Exercises (15-30 minutes each)
1. **Exercise 1**: Build simple GET endpoints
   - Read: `exercise-1-simple-endpoints.md`
   - Practice: Add endpoints to `SimpleTestEndpoints.cs`
   - Test: Use the web interface

2. **Exercise 2**: Master POST endpoints  
   - Read: `exercise-2-map-post-endpoints.md`
   - Practice: Create booking endpoints
   - Test: Use the schedule booking form

### Step 3: Get Creative
- Add your own endpoints
- Modify existing ones
- Experiment with different data types
- Try connecting to real schedule data

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run the API
dotnet run

# Test endpoints (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:5219/hello
curl http://localhost:5219/today
```

## 🎉 Success Checklist

- [ ] Can access `http://localhost:5219/hello`
- [ ] Can see today's date at `http://localhost:5219/today`  
- [ ] Can test endpoints with the web interface
- [ ] Completed Exercise 1 (created 3+ endpoints)
- [ ] Completed Exercise 2 (created POST endpoints)
- [ ] Added at least one creative endpoint

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get the simple endpoints working first
2. **Test Often**: Use the web interface after every change
3. **Read Errors**: Build errors tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Copy Patterns**: Look at existing endpoints for examples
5. **Have Fun**: Experiment and make it your own!
