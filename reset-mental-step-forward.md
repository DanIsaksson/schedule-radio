I have a few days to move forward here. I am not going to force myself to reach the goal set by the teacher, but I want to at least properly understand the implementation of one MapGet and two MapPost endpoints... go easy on me. I'm a beginner, so avoid using too complex syntax language and avoiding presumptions on my understanding. Presume only the utmost basic syntax understanding, nothing more.

## üéØ MY MINIMAL GOAL: Understand 1 MapGet + 2 MapPost endpoints

Good news! I already have these working in my code. Let me break them down in simple terms:

### üìñ MapGet Endpoint (Read Data)
**Endpoint:** `/schedule/today`
**What it does:** Shows today's radio schedule
**Simple explanation:** When you visit this URL, it looks through all 7 days of schedule data and returns only today's information
**Code location:** Line 25-32 in `Program.cs`
**How it works:** 
- It searches through `schedule.Days` to find the day with today's date
- If found, returns that day's data as JSON
- If not found, returns "No schedule for today"

### üìù MapPost Endpoint #1 (Create Data)
**Endpoint:** `/schedule/event/post`
**What it does:** Books a new radio show/event
**Simple explanation:** When you send data to this URL, it tries to book a time slot for a radio show
**Code location:** Line 45-50 in `Program.cs`
**What you need to send:**
- `date`: When you want the show (like 2024-01-15)
- `hour`: What hour (0-23, like 14 for 2 PM)
- `startMinute`: When it starts within that hour (0-59)
- `endMinute`: When it ends within that hour (1-60)
**What you get back:**
- Success: `{ "EventId": 123 }` (your booking number)
- Failure: Error message if time slot is already taken

### üîÑ MapPost Endpoint #2 (Update Data)
**Endpoint:** `/schedule/event/{eventId}/reschedule`
**What it does:** Moves an existing booking to a different time
**Simple explanation:** If you already booked a show but need to change the time, this moves it
**Code location:** Line 83-93 in `Program.cs`
**What you need to send:**
- `eventId`: The booking number you want to move (part of the URL)
- `newDate`: The new date you want
- `newHour`: The new hour (0-23)
- `newStartMinute`: New start minute (0-59)
- `newEndMinute`: New end minute (1-60)
**What you get back:**
- Success: Empty OK response
- Failure: Error message if new time is unavailable

## üß™ TESTING MY ENDPOINTS (Step-by-Step)

### Test 1: See today's schedule (MapGet)
1. Start my API: `dotnet run` in the API folder
2. Open browser and go to: `http://localhost:5219/schedule/today`
3. I should see JSON data with today's hours

### Test 2: Book a new show (MapPost #1)
1. Use a tool like Postman or curl (or I can write a simple test page)
2. Send POST to: `http://localhost:5219/schedule/event/post`
3. Send this data: `{"date":"2024-01-15","hour":14,"startMinute":0,"endMinute":30}`
4. I should get back: `{"EventId":1}` (or similar number)

### Test 3: Move the booking (MapPost #2)
1. Send POST to: `http://localhost:5219/schedule/event/1/reschedule` (use the ID from Test 2)
2. Send this data: `{"newDate":"2024-01-15","newHour":15,"newStartMinute":0,"newEndMinute":30}`
3. I should get back: Empty success response

## üß† WHAT I LEARNED
- **MapGet** = Reading data (like viewing a webpage)
- **MapPost** = Changing data (like submitting a form)
- **Endpoints** are just URLs that do specific jobs
- **JSON** is how the data travels back and forth
- My code already does the hard work - I just need to understand HOW to use it!
