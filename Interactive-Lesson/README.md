# Interactive Lesson Track: Radio Scheduler (Beginner-Friendly)

Welcome. This is a self-paced, hands-on curriculum tailored to this codebase. You’ll read short lessons, run small experiments, and complete labs. Each lesson links directly to files in this repo and uses the codemaps you referenced.

Use this track however you like: scan the index, do lessons in order, or jump to what you need.

## How to Use
- Read a lesson (5–10 min).
- Do the tiny “Try it” box directly in this repository.
- Use the “Check yourself” to validate.
- Open the linked files in your IDE at the specified lines.
- Ask questions in comments or keep notes in the “Scratchpad” files.

## Prereqs (light)
- Basic C# familiarity.
- Treat React/JS as “new to me” — lessons are beginner-first.

## Local URLs (dev)
- API: http://localhost:5219
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

## Codemaps referenced
- Backend codemap: Radio Scheduler Backend API - Complete System Flow
- Frontend codemap: Frontend Radio Scheduler Application

- Dual event systems: Event Management API: In-Memory vs Database CRUD Operations

Tip: Keep both API and frontend running; lessons will ask you to hit endpoints or tweak UI.
