## **WBT** **BBT**

**Advantage** Testing of subcomponents and internal Better verification of the overall system functionality

Less organizational effort Testing of semantic properties with suitable specification Automation through good tool support Portability of systematically created test sequences to platform-independent implementations


**Disadvantage** Compliance with a specification not Greater organizational effort verified

Possible testing _around errors_ Additional functions added during implementation are only tested by chance Test sequences of an insufficient specification are unusable
