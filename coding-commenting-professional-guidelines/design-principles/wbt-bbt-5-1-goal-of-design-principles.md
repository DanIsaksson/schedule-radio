## **WBT** **BBT**
### **5.1 Goal of Design Principles**

_Code must be_ _**KISS**_ _,_ _**DRY**_ _and_ _**YAGNI**_ _!_


[Design principles¹ should lead to good object-oriented design.](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)

  - Code and architecture smells are based on the violation of accepted design principles.

  - Provide important information on how to fix code and architecture smells.

  - If the violated design principle can be identified, it provides a first indication of what a
better structure for the system might look like.
