### **2.12 Cognitive Psychology and Architectural** **Principles**


Over the course of evolution, the human brain has developed impressive mechanisms for
managing complex structures. Cognitive psychology, the study of how the human mind
processes information, focuses on understanding the mental processes underlying behavior, such
as perception, attention, language, problem-solving, and learning.


By understanding these processes, we can design software architectures that are intuitive and
easy to understand. Cognitive psychology provides valuable insights that can be translated into
architectural principles—guidelines or best practices for designing software systems.


These architectural principles typically focus on the overall structure and organization of the
system, aiming to ensure it is maintainable, understandable, and easy to modify. The goal is to
develop software products that maintain consistent quality over the long term, even with varying
development teams.

#### Cognitive Psychology and Architectural Principles


The following mechanisms developed by our brains for handling complex structures have direct mappings to software architecture:


#### Chunking:


**Cognitive Psychology:** Chunking involves grouping individual elements into larger, more manageable units, making it easier to process and remember information.

  - **Software Architecture:** In software design, chunking translates to creating cohesive
modules or components that encapsulate related functionality. This modular approach simplifies development and maintenance.


#### Formation of Hierarchies:


Cognitive Psychology: The brain organizes information into hierarchical structures, facilitating processing and retrieval.


```
  - **Software Architecture:** Hierarchical structuring in software involves organizing components into layers or levels, each with specific roles and responsibilities. This separation of
concerns improves system manageability and scalability.


#### Building of Schemata:


  **Cognitive Psychology:** Schemata are mental models that help us understand and predict
the world around us.

  - **Software Architecture:** In software design, schemata are represented by design patterns
and architectural styles. Consistent use of these patterns helps developers understand the
system’s structure and behavior, making it easier to maintain and extend.


Carola Lilienthal, in her book Sustainable Software Architecture: Analyze and Reduce Technical
Debt, explores how these cognitive mechanisms can be mapped to software architecture. Key
takeaways include:


  Modularity: Breaking down a system into distinct, cohesive modules aligns with the
principle of chunking. Each module should have a clear responsibility and interface,
simplifying development and maintenance.

```
  - **Hierarchization:** Organizing software into hierarchical layers or components ensures that
high-level policies are separated from low-level details. This promotes clear abstraction and decouples different parts of the system.

Pattern Consistency: Using well-known design patterns and architectural styles helps in building schemata. Patterns provide a common language for developers, facilitating communication, understanding, and system evolution.


```
#### Benefits of Cognitive-Inspired Architectural Design


  **Improved Understandability:** Applying cognitive principles helps create a software structure that is easier for developers to understand and work with.

  **Enhanced Maintainability:** By organizing code into manageable chunks and clear hierarchies, the system becomes easier to maintain and extend.

  - **Reduced Technical Debt:** Consistent use of design patterns and modular architecture helps
reduce technical debt, making the system more robust and sustainable over time.


Integrating cognitive psychology principles into software architecture design is crucial for
creating high-quality, maintainable systems. By leveraging chunking, hierarchies, and schemata,
development teams can manage complexity effectively and build systems that are robust
and scalable. For a deeper understanding of these concepts and their practical application,
Carola Lilienthal’s Sustainable Software Architecture: Analyze and Reduce Technical Debt is
an invaluable resource.
