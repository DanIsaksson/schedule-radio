### **What is the goal of this book?**


Readers of this book will acquire in-depth knowledge and skills for the analysis, assessment, and improvement of software quality. You will be able to apply principles, patterns, techniques, and tools needed to write clean code.


```
#### Understanding important concepts of software quality in Java projects:


  - Best Practices

  - Functional and technological scope

  - Development and programming models

  - Tools


#### Learning Objectives:


  - Acquisition of knowledge and skills to analyze, assess and improve software quality

  - Learning principles, patterns, techniques, and tools

  - Deeping technology knowledge

### **Which topics can you expect?**


Software testing is not limited to a specific phase of a project. Already during the coding phase
or the build process, critical and difficult to find software defects can be detected in the source
code. The necessary procedures and tools are presented in this book.


```
#### Among other things, the following topics will be covered:


  - Overview of the basics of software quality

  - Software metrics, metric application in practice

  - Structured design, cohesion, and coupling

  - Overview of Principles, Best Practices, and Code Smells


Preface ii


  - Compliance and verification of Java code conventions

  - Static software testing, especially review techniques and static program analysis

  - Ensure software quality with tools such as SonarQube, PMD, SpotBugs, Checkstyle,
ArchUnit, Taikai and Dependency-Track

  - Software tests with JUnit and Mockito

  - Checking the test code coverage
