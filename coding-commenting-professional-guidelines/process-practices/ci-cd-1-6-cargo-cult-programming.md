### **1.6 Cargo Cult Programming**


In the software development world, there is a phenomenon known
[as Cargo Cult Programming¹¹. The term was first coined by com-](https://archive .org/details/professionalsoft00mcco_0)
puter scientist Richard P. Gabriel in his 1996 essay _Cargo Cult_
_Software Engineering_ . Gabriel used the term to describe the phenomenon of teams of programmers who blindly follow development
methodologies without understanding why they are doing so.


Gabriel compared Cargo Cult Programming to the religious Cargo
Cults of Melanesia. These cults sprang up in the aftermath of World

War II as native Melanesians witnessed the arrival of American Cargo Cult
soldiers with their cargo of supplies. The Melanesians built replicas
of airstrips and control towers in an attempt to attract more American cargo to their island.
Similarly, cargo cult programmers will replicate the development practices in the hope of
achieving the same results.


It is characterized by the ritual of code or program structures that serve no real purpose . The
term Cargo Cult Programmer may apply,
when an unskilled or novice computer programmer copies some program code from one place
to another with little or no understanding of how it works or whether it is required in its
new position. It can also refer to the results of applying a design pattern or coding style blindly
without understanding the reasons behind that design principle.


Cargo Cult Programming is a dangerous form of programming that can lead to buggy, unstable
code. To avoid Cargo Cult Programming, programmers need to be aware of its dangers and be
vigilant in their code reviews.


Overall, Cargo Cult Programming is a harmful development practice that can lead to disastrous
consequences for software projects. Development teams need to be aware of the dangers of this
programming technique and take steps to avoid it.
