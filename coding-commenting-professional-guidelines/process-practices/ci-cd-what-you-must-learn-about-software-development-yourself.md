## - CI/CD
### **What you must learn about Software Development** **yourself?**


  Developers are always wrong   - only the degree to which different developers are wrong
in their endless architecture discussions differs!

  If something can break, it will break   - make sure that a project is foolproof!

```
  - **All code is bad**   - there are only gradual gradations of the defectiveness of a piece of
software!

There is always a bug somewhere   - you just must search long enough!

The most important thing is the customer   - and they don’t give a damn about the technologies and processes used!

Project development on paper does not work   - problems are only identified during the development process!

```
  - **Less is more**   - if something is not necessary, just leave it out!

  **Only 20% of our work consists of coding**   - the rest is designing, debugging, testing,
meetings, discussing, etc.

  - **The customer never knows what he wants**   - everyone has only a vague idea of the desired
result!

  - **Someone has done it before**   - don’t reinvent the wheel!
