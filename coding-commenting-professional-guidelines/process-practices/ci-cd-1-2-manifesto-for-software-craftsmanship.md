### **1.2 Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship**


[The famous Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship¹ describes professional software developers,](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) [and itself reads like an addition to the Agile Manifesto²:](http://agilemanifesto.org/)


In the Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship, the authors make a case for why software development should be considered a craft. They argue that, like any other craft, software development should be done with an emphasis on quality, and that developers should take pride in their work. They also believe that developers should be lifelong learners, always looking to improve their skills.


While the Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship is focused on software development, many of its principles can be applied to other fields as well. In any field, quality should be a primary concern, and pride should be taken in one’s work. Additionally, lifelong learning is essential in any field to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive.


As aspiring Software Craftsmen, we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:


```
  - Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**

  - Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**

  - Not only individuals and interactions, but also **a community of professionals**

  - Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**


That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.


These principles are important because they offer a roadmap for creating software that is not
only functional but also well-designed and maintainable. Following these principles will help
software developers to create code that is more likely to be used and maintained over the long

term.
