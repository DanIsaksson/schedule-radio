### **2.5 Criteria for good design**


When it comes to designing applications, there are a few key criteria that need to be met to create a successful, well-designed architecture.


Functionality is the most important aspect of any design. This means that the design should be able to perform the required tasks and functions effectively and efficiently.


Further, your architecture should be flexible and easily adaptable to changing needs and requirements. As your application changes and grows over time, your architecture should be able to accommodate those changes with minimal effort.


Furthermore, your architecture should be easy to maintain and understand. This is especially important if you have a team of developers working on the same code base. If your architecture is too complex or convoluted, it will be very difficult for developers to make changes or add new features without breaking something else. By keeping your architecture simple and straightforward, you can avoid a lot of headaches down the road. Finally, the design should be scalable. This means that it should be able to handle increased workloads without performance

issues.


These criteria are fractal, i.e., they apply to all levels of the design like architecture, subsystems, and components.


```
