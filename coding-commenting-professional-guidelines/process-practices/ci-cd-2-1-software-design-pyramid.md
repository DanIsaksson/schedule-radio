#### Software Design Pyramid


#### Basic concepts of OOD


The basic concepts of OOD are the prerequisite for this book and will be discussed only briefly
in the following chapter. However, they are the basis for understanding the design principles
and design patterns in the later chapters. The language specification and features of Java
and the implementation of polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance help to
understand and implement them.


```
#### Design Principles


The Design Principles are based on the concepts of the OOD. The best known are the SOLID principles of Robert C. Martin. SOLID is an acronym for five Design Principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These are explained in detail in this book. Besides these, there are many others, which are also described and explained in this book.


```
#### Design Patterns


The Design Patterns go one step further and offer solution patterns for recurring problems.
Probably the best known are the GoF Design Patterns, which are covered in this book with
many examples. Besides the GoF Patterns, there are many more which are also worth studying.


```
#### Architecture Patterns


The Architectural Patterns are at the top of the design pyramid. Architectural Patterns are methods of proven good design structures. More specifically, an Architectural Pattern is a set of design decisions that are repeated in practice, and have well-defined characteristics which can be reused. There are many Architecture Patterns like microkernel, micro-services, layered architecture, event-based, and many more.
