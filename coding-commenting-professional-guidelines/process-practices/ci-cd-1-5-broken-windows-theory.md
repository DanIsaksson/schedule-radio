### **1.5 Broken Windows Theory**


_The importance of fixing the small problems in your code, the “broken windows”, so they don’t_
_grow into large problems._

-
[The Pragmatic Programmer⁹](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)


The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs
of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that
encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests
that policing methods that target minor crimes, such as vandalism, loitering, public
drinking, jaywalking and fare evasion, help to create an atmosphere of order and
lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes. _[–Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)_ ¹⁰

#### Broken Windows Theory


The Broken Window Theory can be used as a metaphor for software development and technical debt on a project.


Every time you delay a fix for a known problem, you create debt. You might know that something is broken, but if you don’t fix it now, you’re in debt. If you have some of these and you are aware of them, that is fine. You make a notice and remove them later. But just like with real debt, it doesn’t take much to get to a point where you can never pay it back. It is the point where you have so many problems that you can never go back and solve them.


You do not want to let technical debt get out of hand. Stop the small problems before they grow into bigger ones. Don’t allow broken windows in your project, but fix them. If you can’t fix them now, create a technical debt ticket to make sure everyone knows they’re broken. A technical debt log helps to provide an overview within a team.


As soon as something is broken and cannot be repaired, it starts to spread throughout the team. The team or new team members get used to these Broken Windows and are not afraid to add new ones. This leads to even worse code and the loss of respect for how you handle the code. Take care of technical debts and solve problems no matter how small they are. Don’t let the code become rotten. The better the code, the less other team members will be tempted to check in bad code.
