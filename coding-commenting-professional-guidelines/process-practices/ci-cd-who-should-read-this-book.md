### **Who should read this book?**


I wrote the book because I want to help developers get experience in clean code or improve it. Get them a feeling of what it is about to be a Software Craftsman. It is about Professionalism, Pragmatism, and Pride!


It’s a mindset, where software developers choose to be responsible for their careers, learning new tools and techniques, and constantly getting better. The journey to Software Craftsmanship is a long one.


That‘s why I wanted to share some techniques and practices for improving code quality and motivating developers.
