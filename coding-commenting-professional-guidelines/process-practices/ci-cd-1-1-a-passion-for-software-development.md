### **1.1 A Passion for Software Development**

_Software Craftsmanship is a long journey to mastery. It’s a mindset where software developers_ _choose to be responsible for their own careers, constantly learning new tools and techniques and_ _constantly bettering themselves._
```
- Sandro Mancuso, The Software Craftsman


The basis of the Software Craftsmanship movement is the publication of _Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin. The author is a cofounder of the Software Craftsmanship movement. There are many
initiatives like the _Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship_ or the
_Clean Code Developer_ movement which raised the bar regarding
software development - luckily.


Software Craftsmanship focuses on the adoption of good technical
practices in the development process. It is obvious, that everyone

![](F:/Code-Projects/00-Study-00/00-Book-Referencing-00/Clean Code Fundamentals - Martin Hock-md/images/clean-code-understand-fundamentals.pdf-14-0.png)
likes Software Craftsmanship. Everybody wants to have a clean code Software Craftsmanship
base, but it’s difficult to achieve. Several steps should also be done in
the right way. The practices defined under the Software Craftsmanship movement are the ones
that will help you to achieve this.


Software Craftsmanship should be the goal you are aiming for. It is not only the maturity of your
project, it is the quality of your software and your codebase as well. As Benjamin Franklin said:
_The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten_ .


Some developers are enthusiastic about their work and have already acquired these values to
provide quality and kindness to the code. They have the necessary skills to realize products
according to their values. Unfortunately, many others know little or not at all that there is another
way to develop software. Even today, many development practices that help to create well-crafted
software are simply not taught in schools.


If you work in an environment where these practices simply are not applied or there is no
room for well-crafted software, ask yourself the question if you can change this. Be a craftsman,
and spread the professionalism of software development out to the team with the hope that
individuals will follow you. Adopt a culture where the values of Software Craftsmanship have
the appropriate value. Do not rank other developers, maybe they had never the chance to work in
this way or had never the luck having a good mentor. When you have success with this approach,
fine. If not, you may be in the wrong company for you!


Introduction to Software Craftsmanship and Clean Code 2


To become a software craftsman, you must first apprentice under a more experienced software
craftsman. This will allow you to learn the trade and develop the skills needed to become a
software craftsman yourself.


No one becomes a software craftsman overnight. It takes years of study and practice to master the
techniques and principles. Good software craftsmen are always learning and constantly striving
to be better.


```
#### Practices that help you strengthen your passion as a software developer:


Understand the importance of _good enough_ .


A working good enough solution is usually better than a non-existent perfect solution. Learn to balance constraints. Don’t get bogged down in the war of beliefs about technologies and the right solution, be pragmatic and effective in what you do. Know where and when to compromise and when to say _enough_ .


```
#### If you get stuck, don’t hesitate to ask for help.


Don’t spend your time endlessly trying to solve a problem that can easily be solved by someone
else. There are people on your team that can you help to solve your problem much faster and
give you valuable tips. Know when to keep trying and when to stop and ask for help.


#### If you are not able to communicate your ideas and connect with others, you will not get
#### far.


Learn how to communicate effectively at every level with the people around you. Get involved
with other ideas, listen to them, and expand your horizons with other points of view. This will
help you to question your views and, in the end, to communicate them to others.


```
#### You will be criticized. Learn how to deal with it.


Understand the value of criticism and learn how to make the most of it. These are opportunities for you to grow and should be valuable feedback provided for you.


#### If you want to make a difference, you need to be effective in prioritizing.


Not everything you can do is always worth doing. Understand how to identify high-impact work and dismiss the rest. Understand the basics and concepts and deepen them. Focus on a few things that you are very interested in while keeping track of other things. Nowadays frameworks come and go, it is more important to understand the concepts behind them. You can apply these to all frameworks coming.


```
#### Learn how you be effective in learning.


Find out the best way for you to learn new things over time. Explaining things to others and
sharing your knowledge is a very effective way to deepen your knowledge and learn new things.


#### Be selective with your valuable time.


You cannot do it all by yourself. If you learn how to delegate effectively, you can multiply your
time for topics that provide more value to you. Be realistic with your goals, you can’t know
everything.


```
#### Share all you learn with everyone else.

Not only you will help others around you to become better, but you will also be strengthening your understanding and growing your knowledge. When knowledge grows in a team and exchange takes place, everyone wins.


```
#### Learn how to motivate others.


If you know how to light a fire and keep it alive, everyone will want to stay around you. Allow
your team members to work in their way and give them the freedom they need to work creatively
and effectively. Set a good example and find out what your colleagues need to be motivated.


```
#### Learn to be proactive.


Don’t wait for problems to become problems. Take care of things in a proactive way.


#### Embrace change.


Change is a natural part of life, and it should be embraced rather than feared. The world is constantly evolving, and software needs to change with it. To stay relevant, software must be constantly updated and improved. Change can be difficult, and it can be scary. But it is also essential for growth. Embracing change is the only way to ensure that your software will evolve and continue to be useful for years to come.


```
#### Refactor fearlessly.


To achieve software craftsmanship, one must be willing to refactor fearlessly. This means being
willing to change the structure of your code to make it more readable, maintainable, and
extensible. It also means being willing to throw away code that is no longer needed. Refactoring
can be scary, especially when you’re working on code that is already working. But remember,
the goal is not to avoid breaking things but to make your code better. And if you’re not afraid to
break things, you’re more likely to end up with truly great code.
