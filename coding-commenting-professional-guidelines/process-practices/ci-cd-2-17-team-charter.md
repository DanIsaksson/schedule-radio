### **2.17 Team Charter**


A team charter is a document that clarifies the direction of the team by setting a vision, mission,
and boundaries that everyone on the team supports. As a source, it illustrates the focus and
direction of the team to others in the organization. The charter should be developed within the
team to promote clear understanding and agreement, providing clarity and reducing confusion
in cases where conflicting tasks or projects arise.


```
